# Human2Anime
Face2Anime is a deep learning project that creates stylized anime faces from real human faces using CycleGAN. In order to facilitate the transmission of creative styles without requiring paired training data, this study investigates unpaired image-to-image translation.

Features
~ Converts human face images into anime-style illustrations.
~ Unpaired training using CycleGAN.
~ Pre-trained models for quick and easy inference.
~ Flexible pipelines for custom datasets and training.
